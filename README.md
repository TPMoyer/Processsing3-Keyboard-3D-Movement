# Processsing3 Keyboard 3D Movement


Sketch is a "Hello World" example to enable keyboard control of the camera (viewpoint) position and orientation.
Sketch is intended for inclusion in the \topics\interaction\  section of the processing examples.

A single .pde encapsulated the cameraKey class.   Copying this into your sketch gets you the full function.   The Keyboard_3D_Movement.pde has the few initialization options needed.

Did set things up to be consistent with the axis orientation taught in USA math and USA physics classes:
+    X positive to the east
+    Y positive to the north
+    Z positive up
     
     
Motion control is:
+   f          key moves you forward
+   b          key moves you backward
+   left-arrow key moves you left
+   righ-arrow key moves you right
+   up-arrow   key moves you up 
+   down-arrow key moves you down

+   r key rolls you clockwize (left wing up)
+   c key CounterClockwise rolls you (right wing up)
+   shift-left-arrow  turns  your nose left  
+   shift-right-arrow turns  your nose right
+   shift-up-arrow    pushes your nose down 
+   shift-down-arrow  pulls  your nose up  
   
+   The speed at which you movement occurs can be halved  by hitting F1
+   The speed at which you movement occurs can be doubled by hitting F2
   
+   The speed at which you turning occurs can be halved  by hitting F3
+   The speed at which you turning occurs can be doubled by hitting F4
